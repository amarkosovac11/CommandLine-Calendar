# Command-Line Calendar
## **Description**
Command-Line Calendar is an easy-to-use calendar application which comes with few specific features and functions. This application provides user a simple and convenient way to view the calendar for a specific month of some particular year. Features that come with this calendar are: adding reminders to specific dates, viewing monthly calendars and viewing events that are saved in a local file. 
## **Project Goals**
The main objective of this project is to provide a lightweight, simple and scalable calendar solution that can be used at the command line without the need for a graphical user interface. It aims to provide easy date and event management, helping users stay organized and productive .
## **How to use Command-Line Calendar**
Since this is Command-Line project everything is happening in Terminal. When we run the program, 4 functions show up in the terminal: View Date, Add Event, View Events and Exit.
1.	View Date: This function prompts the user to input a specific year and month, then generates a calendar view for that month. The function prints the month's name and displays a formatted calendar grid showing the days.
2.	Add Event: This function allows users to enter the details for a new event, including the day, month, year and a description. The event is then stored and it is written to local file named "Events.txt," ensuring that the event details are saved for future reference.
3.	View Events: This function displays all events currently stored in the calendar. It checks if there are any events and, if so, it prints each eventâ€™s details. If there are no events, it informs the user that there are no events to display.
4.	Delete Event: This function will ask user to inout date of the event he wants to delete. If there is any stored event with that date, it will be deleted, if not it will display message "There is no event with that date".
5.	Exit: This function allows users to safely exit the program.
## **Technologies Used**
This project will be developed in three different programming languages to enhance cross-language proficiency and provide flexibility:

1. JavaScript
2. C#
3. Python
   
Each group member is responsible for implementing the calendar in one of these languages, ensuring collaborative and diverse contributions.
